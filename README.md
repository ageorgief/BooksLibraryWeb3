BooksLibrary contract iteractions example.

## üìå Prerequisites

If you are Windows user please consider using a proper [terminal app](https://hyper.is/).

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required to install dependencies and run project.

Recommended Node.js version: `18.13.0`

If you use another version, please use [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage.

Optionally [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) could be used instead of `npm`.

For optimal developer friendly experience use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the following plugins:

- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) - High level code formatter
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - More customisable code formatter
- [ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) - React code snippets and autocomplete

A Web3 wallet is required as well. In our case we use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). Project contracts are deployed at [Sepolia test network](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059213492-ETH-on-Sepolia-and-Goerli-networks-testnets-) so please [change](https://medium.com/@mwhc00/how-to-enable-ethereum-test-networks-on-metamask-again-d7831da23a09) to that network in Metamask.
